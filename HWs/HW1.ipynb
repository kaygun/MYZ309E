    "Overall rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not split your answers into separate files. All answers must be in a single jupyter notebook. \n",
    "- Refrain from downloading and loading data from a local file unless specifically specified. Obtain all required remote data using the appropriate API.\n",
    "- Refrain from cleaning data by hand on a spreadsheet. All cleaning must be done programmatically, with each step explained. This is so that I can replicate the procedure deterministically.\n",
    "- Refrain from using code comments to explain what has been done. Document your steps by writing appropriate markdown cells in your notebook.\n",
    "- Avoid duplicating code by copying and pasting it from one cell to another. If copying and pasting is necessary, develop a suitable function for the task at hand and call that function.\n",
    "- When providing parameters to a function, never use global variables. Instead, always pass parameters explicitly and always make use of local variables.\n",
    "- Document your use of LLM models (ChatGPT, Claude, Code Pilot etc). Either take screenshots of your steps and include them with this notebook, or give me a full log (both questions and answers) in a markdown file named HW1-LLM-LOG.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in a 15-point deduction for each infraction."

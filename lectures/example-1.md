Explain what the following block of python code does with the context given above. Be direct.
The audience knows the mathematical theory behind the code. So, provide mathematical details
with formulas if necessary.

    X = np.array([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10], dtype=float)
    Y = np.array([3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14], dtype=float)
    mean_x = X.mean()
    mean_y = Y.mean()
    m = ((X - mean_x) * (Y - mean_y)).sum() / np.power(X - mean_x, 2).sum()
    b = mean_y - m * mean_x
	
</task>
```

# Answer \# 1

The provided Python code block is implementing the calculation of the parameters for a simple linear regression line. The goal is to find the best-fit line through a set of points, which minimizes the sum 
of squared differences between observed values and those predicted by the line. This can be described mathematically as finding $m$ (the slope) and $b$ (the y-intercept) in the linear equation:

$$ Y = mX + b $$

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - `X` and `Y` are numpy arrays representing the independent variable data points and dependent variable data points, respectively.
   - These are converted to float type to ensure accurate calculations.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - `mean_x = X.mean()`: Computes the mean (average) of all values in array $X$.
   - `mean_y = Y.mean()`: Computes the mean (average) of all values in array $Y$.

3. **Slope Calculation ($m$)**:
   - The formula for calculating the slope $m$ is derived from the least squares method and can be expressed as:

     $$
     m = \frac{\sum{(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}}{\sum{(X_i - \bar{X})^2}}
     $$

   - `((X - mean_x) * (Y - mean_y)).sum()`: Computes the numerator, which is the sum of products of deviations of $X$ and $Y$ from their respective means.
   - `np.power(X - mean_x, 2).sum()`: Computes the denominator, which is the sum of squared deviations of $X$ from its mean.

4. **Intercept Calculation ($b$)**:
   - Once the slope $m$ is known, the y-intercept $b$ can be calculated using:

     $$
     b = \bar{Y} - m \times \bar{X}
     $$

   - `b = mean_y - m * mean_x`: Implements this formula to compute the intercept.

Overall, the code calculates the slope and intercept for a linear regression model that fits the data points defined in arrays $X$ and $Y$. This line can then be used to predict $Y$ values given new $X$ inputs.

# Answer \# 2

The provided code snippet is written using DuckDB, which is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system. It's designed to handle analytical queries on datasets and is especially useful for working 
with large dataframes directly in Python.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what the code does:

1. **Database Connection**:
   - The code assumes that there is a DuckDB database instance named `db`. This instance is used to execute SQL queries against the dataset, which we assume has been loaded into this database under the 
table name `data`.

2. **SQL Query Execution**:
   - `db.sql(...)`: Executes an SQL query within the context of the connected DuckDB instance.
   
3. **SQL Query Details**:
   - The SQL query is wrapped in a string and passed to `db.sql()`. It performs several operations on the dataset:

     ```sql
     SELECT sum(number_of_passage) as total, transition_hour as hour 
     FROM data
     WHERE road_type = 'RAYLI'
     GROUP BY hour
     ORDER BY hour;
     ```
   
   - **SELECT Clause**: Specifies that we want to retrieve two columns:
     - `sum(number_of_passage) as total`: Computes the sum of the `number_of_passage` column for each group and labels it as `total`.
     - `transition_hour as hour`: Selects the `transition_hour` column and renames it as `hour`.

   - **FROM Clause**: Indicates that the data is being selected from a table named `data`.

   - **WHERE Clause**: Filters the dataset to include only rows where the `road_type` is equal to `'RAYLI'`. This means we're focusing our analysis specifically on transportation events occurring on roads 
of this type.

   - **GROUP BY Clause**: Groups the results by the `transition_hour`. For each unique hour, it calculates the sum of `number_of_passage`.

   - **ORDER BY Clause**: Orders the final output by `hour` in ascending order. This ensures that the result set is sorted chronologically by hour.

4. **Conversion to DataFrame**:
   - `.to_df()`: Converts the resulting SQL query result into a pandas DataFrame, which is stored in the variable `result`.

5. **Purpose of the Code**:
   - The overall purpose of this code block is to calculate and organize the total number of passages that occur for each hour on roads classified as `'RAYLI'`. The output is a structured DataFrame where 
each row represents an hour with its corresponding total number of passages.

This analysis could be useful for understanding traffic patterns or passenger flow specifically related to certain road types during different hours of the day.

How do we import the data into a DataFrame using pandas library?
</instructions>
```

## Answer

To import the hourly transportation data into a DataFrame using pandas, you can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the dataset
url = 'https://data.ibb.gov.tr/tr/dataset/a6855ce7-4092-40a5-82b5-34cf3c7e36e3/resource/ea8daee8-62e4-4c42-903f-15b5e372d902/download/hourly_transportation_202410.csv'

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Print the first few rows of the DataFrame to verify the data
print(df.head())
```

This code imports the pandas library, sets the URL of the dataset, reads the CSV file into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`, and prints the first few rows of the DataFrame to ensure that the data was 
imported correctly.

Please note that you may need to install the required libraries (in this case, pandas) by running `pip install pandas` in your command line before running this code.

Using duckdb, write a piece of code that filters the dataframe where the column 'road_type' is 'RAYLI'.
</instruction>
```

## Answer

Here's an example of how you can filter the DataFrame using DuckDB:

```sql
-- Create a connection to the dataset
CREATE TABLE hourly_transportation AS SELECT * FROM @hourly_transportation_202410;

-- Filter the DataFrame where 'road_type' is 'RAYLI'
SELECT * FROM hourly_transportation WHERE road_type = 'RAYLI';
```

However, since we're using pandas and DuckDB's python interface (pyduckdb), we can use the following code:

```python
import pyducksql

# Create a connection to the dataset
conn = pyducksql.connect('https://data.ibb.gov.tr/tr/dataset/a6855ce7-4092-40a5-82b5-34cf3c7e36e3/resource/ea8daee8-62e4-4c42-903f-15b5e372d902/download/hourly_transportation_202410.csv')

# Filter the DataFrame where 'road_type' is 'RAYLI'
df_filtered = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM hourly_transportation WHERE road_type = \'RAYLI\'')

# Print the filtered DataFrame
print(df_filtered)
```

This code connects to the dataset, filters the DataFrame using DuckDB's SQL syntax, and prints the filtered results.

## Answer

Hereâ€™s how you can filter the DataFrame using DuckDB for rows where road_type is 'RAYLI':

``` python
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

# Load the data
url = "https://data.ibb.gov.tr/tr/dataset/a6855ce7-4092-40a5-82b5-34cf3c7e36e3/resource/ea8daee8-62e4-4c42-903f-15b5e372d902/download/hourly_transportation_202410.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Use DuckDB to filter the DataFrame
query = "SELECT * FROM df WHERE road_type = 'RAYLI'"
filtered_df = duckdb.query(query).to_df()

# Display the filtered data
print(filtered_df.head())
```

## Prompt

```
Write a piece of code using duckdb that filters the dataframe where the column 'road_type' is 'RAYLI' and group by the column transition_hour. Then the code should sum up number_of_passage and finally display the results by sorting the results with respect to transition_hour.
```

## Answer

Hereâ€™s a complete code snippet using DuckDB to filter, group, sum, and sort the DataFrame as specified:

``` python
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

# Load the data
url = "https://data.ibb.gov.tr/tr/dataset/a6855ce7-4092-40a5-82b5-34cf3c7e36e3/resource/ea8daee8-62e4-4c42-903f-15b5e372d902/download/hourly_transportation_202410.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# DuckDB query to filter, group, sum, and sort
query = """
SELECT 
    transition_hour, 
    SUM(number_of_passage) AS total_passages
FROM df
WHERE road_type = 'RAYLI'
GROUP BY transition_hour
ORDER BY transition_hour
"""

# Execute the query
result_df = duckdb.query(query).to_df()

# Display the result
print(result_df)
```

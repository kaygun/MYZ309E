## Course overview

### Who am I?

Originally theoretical math (algebra) turned data analyst by demand

- statical data analysis
- time series analysis
- text analysis
- topological data analysis

## Syllabus and Assessment

### Overview of the Syllabus

### Assessment

- 4 homework projects 
- final proposal (2000 words)
- final project (5000 words)

### The Final Proposal

- minimum of 2000 words (~4 pages)
- dataset(s) with detailed description
- questions you ask the dataset(s)
- methods you are going to use
- list of team members
- division of labor (who will do what)

### The Final Project

- minimum 5000 words (~10 pages)
- dataset(s)
- hardware and software
- question(s)
- methods to extract answers from the dataset(s)
- obstacles and solutions
- analysis (what, why, how)
- workload breakdown (who, what, how much work)

### Use of LLMs

I allow and even encourage students to large language models (ChatGPT, Claude2, LLAMA2 etc).

Your required to document the usage through logged transcripts.

Transparency and maintaining academic integrity.


## The Tools

### Python 

- Popular open source programming language
- Flexible language good for beginners
- Widely used in industry and research
- Many libraries for data analysis 
  + Pandas, 
  + Numpy, 
  + Scikit-Learn etc.

### Jupyter Notebooks

Notebooks are ideal for constructing a coherent narrative analysis of data because

- Interactive
- Versatile (many languages) [JU](https://julialang.org/)(lia)[PYT](https://www.python.org/)(hon)e[R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- Supports code, text, and visualization in the same context

### Package Managers

Package manager manages the libraries installed on your system:

- [anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### Online Compute Platforms

* [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) 
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/notebooks-at-microsoft/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

### Git

Git is a version control system. [(Image source)](https://github.com/crc8/GitVersionTree)

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup
language like HTML, but [much simpler](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
